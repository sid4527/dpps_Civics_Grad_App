<h2>Voter Registration/Encouragement</h2>
<p>Voter Encouragement & Registration is defined as interacting with potential voters to promote voting. <br>
    Interaction could be asking people: whether they are registered to vote, going to vote, did vote or thanking them for voting.<br> 
    This could also mean that you have handed out literature related to voting or registering people to vote.
