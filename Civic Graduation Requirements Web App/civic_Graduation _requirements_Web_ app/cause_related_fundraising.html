<h1>DPPS Civics - Graduation Requirement Tracker 2019-2020</h1>
<h2>Cause-Related Fundraising</h2>
<p>Cause related fundraising involves raising funds or in-kind donations for a cause or an<br>
     organization other than yourself or a family member. Examples include raising money for <br>
     cancer, a school dance, gun violence awareness, etc. If you are successful at this then you <br>
     feel comfortable designing a plan to raise <br>
     money, can execute that plan and complete any compliance documents related to the fundraising.
