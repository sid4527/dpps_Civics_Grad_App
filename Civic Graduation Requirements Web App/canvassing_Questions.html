<h2>Canvassing</h2>
<p>Canvassing is when you engage in direct contact with people who you seek to influence. <br>
    Generally this is done in the form of canvassing on the street: stopping people and talking to them,<br>
    or door to door canvassing when you pick a location or building and talk to residents. <br>
    If you are successful at this then you can easily interact with citizens on the street or in their homes to <br>
    discuss with them a certain platform.
