<h1>DPPS Civics - Graduation Requirement Tracker 2019-2020</h1>
<h2>In-Person Lobbying</h2>
<p>Lobbying means the attempt to influence decisions made by officials in the high leverage positions. <br>
    Examples of high leverage positions: a member of the government, a principal or superintendent, a chief executive officer, etc. <br> 
    If you are successful at this you will have set up a meeting with someone in a high leverage position and met with him/her.
